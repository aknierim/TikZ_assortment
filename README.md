# TikZ_assortment

This is a collection of TikZ graphics I have made over the years. They are mostly for my own use,
but I thought I might as well share them.

## Contents

* `BA_Pipeline` - A graphical representation of my Bachelor's thesis data pipeline. Can be adapted for other purposes (i.e. anytime you need a flow chart of some sort).

* `Cherenkov_Radiation` - A graphical representation of the Cherenkov radiation emitted by a particle traveling faster than the speed of light in a medium.

* `Heitler_Model` - A graphical representation of the Heitler model of the electromagnetic component of an extensive air shower (EAS).

* `Brillouin_Hexagons` - Hexagonal lattice and its first Brillouin zone.

* `XKCD_Astronomer` - A sketch of an astronomer with a telescope, inspired by the XKCD comics.

## Usage

Either compile all the files at once by calling
```
make
```
in the root directory of this repository, or compile each graphic individually by calling `make` inside the respective directory.
